## What is tasteguard?
Tasteguard is an interactive map of over a thousand NYC restaurants containing inspection data for those restaurants in the last 365 days. Leveraging NYC Open Data's API, this map was created to inform New Yorkers about the restaurants they've gone to or are planning to go to, indicating any violations the restaurant has made in the past year based on restaurant inspections. I hope to enhance the safetiness of New Yorkers with this website, steering them away from restaurants with poor sanitation, rodent/roach sightings, improper food, etc.
